    fresh start with everything from the beginning.
    got a physical computer to perform the tests on.
    removed packages:
        App.StepsRecorder
        App.Support.QuickAssist
        Browser.InternetExplorer
        hello.face
        Language.handwriting
        Language.ocr
        Language.speech
        Language.TexttoSpeech
        MathRecognizer
        Media.WindowsMediaPlayer
        Microsoft.Windows.MSPaint
        Microsoft.Windows.Notepad
        Microsoft.Windows.PowerShell.ISE
        Microsoft.Windows.WordPad
        OneCoreUAP.OneSync
        OpenSSH.Client
    i have also noted that when remvoving for example,
    Language.OCR* it removes it for all of the available languages
    the Capability Windows.Client.ShellComponents is IMPORTANT
    I decided to keep the following capabilities:
        Print.Fax.Scan
        Print.Management.Console
        because they can be important while printers are being used!
    at this stage the wim file was exported with recovery compression,
    to an esd file type, and added to the iso file using (ULTRAISO),
    to keep boot sectors and not to be updated with other tools.
    [post installation of a physical machine]
        no changes were made, the image was properly committed.
        commit instructions were updated in commit.ps1 file
        commit.ps1: added Start Component Cleanup
        commit.ps1: added Reset Base
        commit.ps1: added scan health
        commit.ps1: added unmount
        [post installation on a physical]
        this time i will try with HBCD and WinntSetup to apply the image to the drive
        while using the hirens Winntsetup method i get an error and the installation is distrupted.
        today the the experience was successful to make a minimal version of windows 10
        the sucessful attempt was made possible after exporting a win file format to an esd
        all the pervious changes should be noted, and installed again in a physical machine and 
        observe the functionality on the physical computer, and eventually continue processing
        the install.esd image file for further improvements.
        two folders were noticed in WinSxS folder, one is Temp and the other is backup,
        both of the above monetioned folders contains files which are likely to be safe-to-remove
        the change log file should not be extended and rewrited and attached with the last modification,
        to server as a backup on the servers

    many researches were done about windows registry, to collect the values needed to be changed,
    corresponding to the work system.

        an iso made after the 2nd part of modifications, and
        *the execution policy of powershell was set to bypass (which was changed after mounting the registry offline)
        *windows capabilities were sucessfully removed from the system in today's session.
        some annoying apps are still at the start menu and can't be removed during the serviceing, like spotify and sollitare collection
        the user hanebutt was created automatically
        *changes were made sucessfully, this 2nd ESD Image will be the base.
